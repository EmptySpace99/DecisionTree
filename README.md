# DecisionTree

A decision tree is a predictive model useful for different purposes and often used as a tool for decision support.

I have implemented a C++ program that is able to:
1) read a decision tree from file and modify it with le
operations delete node, add node, edit node;
2) visualize the decision tree in text mode;
3) infer and visualize the variables of the decision tree
(in the example in the figure, the program should display
Age, Risk and Type);
4) make a prediction starting from a tree of
previously entered decision. In particular the
program should ask the user, one at a time, the
values to be associated with the variables during the path that leads
to prediction;
5) make a prediction starting from a tree of
previously entered decision and from a set of
variable values. The program must ask for a
set of pairs (variable, value)
